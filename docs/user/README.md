2. **Setting up a system?** Go to [setup.md](setup.md)

## Documentation Philosophy

This user documentation follows these principles:

- **Practical over theoretical** - Focus on what you need to do, not how it's built
- **Examples over descriptions** - Show actual commands and workflows
- **Troubleshooting included** - Help for when things go wrong
- **Progressive detail** - Start broad, get specific as needed

All documentation assumes you want to **use** ARABLE effectively, not necessarily understand every implementation detail.
