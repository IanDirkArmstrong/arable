# Technical Documentation

This directory contains technical project documentation for **developing, maintaining, and coordinating** ARABLE development work.

## Documentation Files

- **[project_instructions.md](project_instructions.md)** - Agent roles, protocols, and team coordination guidelines
- **[file_index.md](file_index.md)** - Complete file system organization, status tracking, and maintenance protocols
- **[architecture_plan.md](architecture_plan.md)** - Original architecture planning, design decisions, and technical specifications

## Future Documentation Areas

- **[agents/](agents/)** - Agent-specific technical documentation and implementation guides
- **[integrations/](integrations/)** - API integration setup, patterns, and troubleshooting
- **[workflows/](workflows/)** - Business process automation templates and technical implementation

## Target Audience

- **Developers** working on ARABLE code
- **Project Manager Agent** coordinating across development work
- **Index Keeper Agent** maintaining file organization
- **Technical team members** (Code Developer, Integration Architect, etc.)
- **Future maintainers** who need to understand the system architecture

## Key Documents for Different Roles

### Project Management
- **[project_instructions.md](project_instructions.md)** - Role definitions and coordination protocols
- **[file_index.md](file_index.md)** - Current project status and file organization

### Development Work
- **[architecture_plan.md](architecture_plan.md)** - Technical design and implementation guidance
- **[file_index.md](file_index.md)** - Code organization and module status

### System Maintenance
- **[file_index.md](file_index.md)** - Complete system inventory and maintenance protocols
- **[project_instructions.md](project_instructions.md)** - Working protocols and responsibilities

## Documentation Maintenance

This technical documentation is maintained by the **Index Keeper Agent** and updated by various project agents as they make changes. Key protocols:

1. **Update file_index.md** when files are added, removed, or significantly changed
2. **Document architectural decisions** in relevant technical documents
3. **Track project status** and development progress
4. **Coordinate between agent roles** using project_instructions.md

## Relationship to User Documentation

This technical documentation supports the development and maintenance of ARABLE, while the `/user/` documentation supports **using** ARABLE. Technical docs focus on:

- **How it's built** vs. how it's used
- **Development coordination** vs. user workflows  
- **Implementation details** vs. practical operation
- **Project management** vs. system administration

Both documentation sets work together to support the complete ARABLE ecosystem.
